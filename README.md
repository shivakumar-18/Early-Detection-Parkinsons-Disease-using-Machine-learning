# Early-Detection-Parkinsons-Disease-using-Machine-learning
In this project our aims to detect the Parkinsons Disease Early 
Early identification followed by right medication can reduce the tremors  and imbalance symptoms in patients, enabling them to lead a normal life.
Patients with Parkinsonâ€™s (PWP) rely on early detection and tailored treatments to slow the progress of the disease.
