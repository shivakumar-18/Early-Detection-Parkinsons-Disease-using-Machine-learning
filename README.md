# Early-Detection-Parkinsons-Disease-using-Machine-learning
In this project, our aim is to detect Parkinsons' Disease Early. 
Early identification followed by the right medication can reduce the tremors  and imbalance symptoms in patients, enabling them to lead a normal life.
Patients with Parkinsonâ€™s (PWP) rely on early detection and tailored treatments to slow the progress of the disease.
Dataset Details:

In this project the dataset that I used
**Dataset Used :** Parkinsons Disease Dataset <br>
**Dataset Source :** UCI Machine Learning Repository <br>
**Dataset Hosting URL:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/parkinsons.data

The following Machine Learning Models that I used in this project
1. Support vector Machine (SVM)
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbours
4. Logistic Regression

Results: Random forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 91.83% compared to other SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression Models
